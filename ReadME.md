Teensy 3.1
===
If you have been following along at all on the Lynxmotion or Trossen Forums, you probably noticed that I am having a lot of fun with the Teensy 3.1 processors.  For those who don't know anything about the Teensy, you should look up at: http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html

You can also purchase these at some other places including:

Breakout Boards
===
I have been having some fun using DipTrace to design some logical break out boards for the Teensy.  There is lots of stuff talking about these boards up on Lynxmotion

These boards are described and talked about on several forum threads including:

Fabrication

The zip files that I have included in this project are sufficient to send off to at least a few different places.  The ones I have used for this are OSHPark and Seeedstudio.  You simply have to start the order process and upload the zip files...

Teensy Shield with XBee
---

This board was designed to be the same size as several of the boards I have used over the years from Lynxmotion and Basic Micro.  In particular they are 3" by 2.3" and have mounting holes that are .15" in from the corners. 

The boards are setup with 3 pin servo headers for many of the IO pins as well, there is connectors for Robotis Ax Servos, plus other stuff, such as XBee and Speaker.  

Teensy Shield with Arduino Headers
---

This breakout board is a bit larger, as some others were interested in having Arduino stackable headers, so I am currently playing around with a V.01 of this, which appears to be working. 

Other Breakout Boards
---

There are some others who are developing much simpler breakout boards for the Teensy 3.1 that have Arduino headers and the like.  There is several threads talking about this including one on the Teensy forum:

Questions
===

Again this is a DIY project, If you have any questions or suggestions, it is probably easiest to discuss it up on the different forums: Lynxmotion, Trossen Robotics, PJRC.

Thanks
